# Impress Your Crush

This is a playful web project designed to create an interactive experience, potentially to impress someone special. The application presents a fun scenario where the user is prompted with a question and can interact with dynamic buttons leading to different outcomes.



## Introduction

The "Impress Your Crush" project is a light-hearted web application that engages users with a playful question: "Do you love me?" Depending on the user's choice, the application responds with different scenarios, incorporating dynamic button movements and humorous messages to enhance user interaction.

## Features

- **Interactive Questioning**: Presents a central question with "Yes" and "No" options.
- **Dynamic Button Movement**: The "No" button moves away when hovered over, making it challenging to click.
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Different responses and pages are displayed based on user choices.
- **Humorous Content**: Incorporates playful messages and GIFs to entertain users.

## Project Structure

The project comprises the following key files:

- `index.html`: The main page displaying the initial question.
- `yes.html`: Displayed when the user selects "Yes," featuring a positive message.
- `no1.html`, `no2.html`, `no3.html`: Pages shown when the user attempts to select "No," each with unique content.
- `style.css`: Contains styling rules for the application's layout and design.
- `script.js`: Includes JavaScript functions for interactivity, such as the movement of the "No" button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic content handling.
